# PPE Kit Detection in Automobile Manufacturing

This project focuses on detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in an automobile manufacturing environment using computer vision techniques.  
By leveraging YOLOv3 and YOLOv8 object detection models, the system identifies the presence or absence of essential safety gear such as helmets, gloves, masks, vests, and shoes in real-time video streams.  
This tool aims to enhance workplace safety by ensuring compliance with PPE protocols.

# 🛡️ PPE Kit Detection Using YOLOv3

This project aims to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, vests, and masks in real-time using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. It is built using Python, OpenCV, Flask, and pre-trained YOLO weights.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time video stream PPE detection
- Upload video or use webcam for detection
- Frontend dashboard using HTML/CSS/JS
- Flask backend for model integration
- YOLOv3 for high-speed and accurate object detection

## 🎯 Use Case

This project is ideal for:
- Monitoring safety compliance in industrial environments
- Enhancing workplace safety
- Detecting missing PPE gear in manufacturing units
